  console command. When this cvar is empty (default), *referee*

  as *g_weaponDisable*. The later cvar affects only weapons and ammo
  spawned on a map. Setting this cvar to 0 restores original behaviour
  of *g_weaponDisable*.

g_teamForceBalance <number>
  Prevents players from joining the weaker team if difference
  is greater than *number*.

g_teamsizeMin <size>
  Minimum votable teamsize.

g_timeoutDuration <seconds>
  Duration of a player timeout.

g_timeoutLimit <number>
  Maximum number of times a player is allowed to call a timeout.

g_unlagged <0|1|2>
  Experimental "unlagged" disruptor hit detection. 2 accounts for
  doors and other movers too at some server performance penalty.

g_unlaggedMaxPing <msec>
  Maximum lag compensation. Unlagged has subjective, counter-intuitive
  side effects. For example a player can be hit some time after he hid
  behind an obstacle. This cvar's value limits time period in which
  this can happen, adding extra hit detection delay for players with
  pings higher than *msec*.

g_warmup <0|1>
  SaberMod has a new warmup system. All players must ready up with
  *ready* command before a match can start. Old *g_warmupTime* Cvar is
  no longer used. Setting this cvar to 0 disables warmup alltogether.

  Players become vampires and they drain health when damaging
  enemy. *ratio* value determines how much health is drained for 1
  point of damage. It may be set to a negative value.

g_voteCooldown <seconds>
  How long a player has to wait before he can call another vote.

Round-Based Gametypes
.....................

In round-based gametypes players spawn with all available weapons and
items (controlled by *g_spawnWeapons* and *g_spawnItems* cvars),
however there are no pickups on the map. Players gain one point for
killing an enemy and one point for each 50 damage dealt to the enemy
team. A round lasts until either one team is eliminated or a timelimit
is hit. Match ends when a roundlimit is hit.

Red Rover (g_gametype 9)
  It can be described as FFA with a twist. There are two teams, player
  who gets killed respawns in the opposing team. Round ends when one
  team is eliminated, but the match winner is a person who scores most
  points.

Clan Arena (g_gametype 10)
  Player who dies must spectate until the end of a round. When one
  team is eliminated, round is over. Team who hits the round limit
  first wins the match.

Server Modes
............

Server administrator can configure a number of custom game "modes",
players will be able to choose from. A mode is technically a config
file in ``modes/`` directory that will be executed when players
sucessfuly vote to use it. It can contain any commands altering server
behaviour, but please take following guides into consideration.

Switching to a mode from any other should always result in the same
server state. To achieve this it's best to use a "reset" config,
executed at the start of each mode config. It should contain a default
value for every possible cvar your modes are changing. Examine
included modes and ``reset.cfg`` as an example.

Server can be configured to go back to a default mode after a period
of inactivity. To do so last lines of the main server config should
resemble following template::

  set g_modeIdleTime "10"
  set g_modeDefault "mymode"
  exec "modes/mymode"
  map ffa_bespin

Where *mymode* is the default mode.

Building SaberMod
=================

SaberMod has several build scripts, but only GNU Make script is
complete and used for official releases. other scripts produce
different QVM files from the same source code.

GNU Make
--------

Only requirements are GNU Make, Git and GCC or Clang
compiler. Makefile has several targets, type ``make <target>`` to
build selected target. Most useful are:

- **shared** build shared module libraries that should be used for
  debugging and development.
- **assets** create assets.pk3 - an amalgamation of all SaberMod
  clientside and serverside assets which is useful for development, as
  they will not be loaded from outside of a pk3.
- **serverside** create a full release zip package.

Type ``make help`` to learn about remaining targets.

Microsoft Visual Studio
-----------------------

Install Git command line program on your system. It can be done from
Visual Studio Team Explorer tab. Use *Clone Git Repository* and
provide address of your SaberMod repo. *Build All* action compiles
.dll modules. Other targets can be compiled from *CMake Targets View*
in *Project Explorer*.

CMake
-----

Install CMake for your operating system (Linux, Windows, MacOS and
others) and use ``CMakelists.txt`` script from the main SaberMod
directory.

Batch Scripts
-------------

Copy lcc.exe and q3asm.exe tools from *JK2 Editing Tools 2.0* into
bin/ directory. Run ``code/buildvms.bat`` batch script to generate
.qvm files.
